  <h1>Comparative Analysis: Spain vs United Kingdom Vaccination Schedules</h1>

  <section>
    <h2>Infants (0–3 years)</h2>
    <p>Both countries administer hexavalent vaccines covering DTaP/IPV/Hib/HepB at 2 and 4 months. Spain and the UK provide MenB and rotavirus vaccines early in life, though Spain's regional differences limited MenB coverage until recently. Spain administers PCV at 6 months, while the UK includes it at 4 months. Booster doses (Hib-HepB in Spain, Hib/MenC in the UK) and MenB boosters are given at 11–12 months in both countries. Measles outbreaks have led both nations to bring forward the MMR vaccine: the UK to 18 months, Spain to 2 years.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Children and Adolescents (3–18 years)</h2>
    <p>Spain administers the 2nd dose of MMR and DTaP/IPV around age 6. Both countries vaccinate against HPV at 12–13 years for both sexes. Spain includes MenACWY (12–14 years) and Td (14 years), while the UK centralizes these at 14 years. Spain offers chickenpox (VZV) vaccine routinely at 15 months and again at 3–4 years. The UK does not include VZV routinely, preferring natural immunity. Spain also recommends flu vaccination from 6 months to 18 years, prioritizing 6–59 months. The UK focuses more on operational efficiency via school-based delivery.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Adults (19+ years)</h2>
    <p>Both countries offer annual flu and pneumococcal vaccination to older adults. Spain's herpes zoster (Shingrix) vaccine at 65 depends on regional implementation, while the UK has used it routinely for years. RSV vaccination is now routine in the UK for people aged 75+, while Spain has not yet implemented this. Spain relies more on regional decisions, causing inequality in access, whereas the UK’s central model ensures uniform delivery.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Pregnant Women</h2>
    <p>Both countries recommend dTpa and flu vaccines during pregnancy starting at week 16. The UK runs national awareness campaigns, especially after increases in infant deaths from whooping cough. Spain relies more on local healthcare professionals. COVID-19 vaccines are promoted in both, with the UK including pregnant women systematically and Spain following local availability and regional strategy.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>General Comparison</h2>
    <p>Spain operates under a decentralized system where each autonomous community can adapt the national vaccination calendar. This has resulted in uneven implementation of some vaccines (e.g., MenB, rotavirus, zoster). The UK uses a centralized model through the JCVI, enabling rapid, uniform nationwide implementation. Spain tends to favor broader, universal immunization (e.g., varicella, MenB in infants), while the UK focuses on epidemiological efficiency and cost-effectiveness (e.g., limited VZV, delayed MMR). Spain prioritizes early coverage for diseases with reemergence, while the UK addresses structural coverage issues with earlier boosters and campaigns.</p>
